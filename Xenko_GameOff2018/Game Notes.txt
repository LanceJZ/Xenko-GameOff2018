Hybrid Resource collection/RPG/Base Defense.

Ore collection from asteroids.
As level of player goes up they can tell what ore the asteroid contains.
Bases build ships that attack player.
Super base build ships that attacks player's home base.
When players home gets distroyed Game Over.
Player uses ore to repair or build up home base.
Player gets some exp from mining most from fighting.
The base makes little ship drones that chase the player and fire at it. The base shoots misiles at the player, once every ten secons at level one.
The player has shields that the player needs to turn on to use, and off to recharge. Discharge rate when on is 1 unit a second. Base sheilds are 100 points and can be upgraded as the player level goes up so that they drain slower. When a drone shoots the player that takes 4 shield points. If a drone hits the player that takes 6 points. If a base shoots the player that takes 10 points for a level one base.
The player ship has hit points. Base starts at 100 points. Damage is double that of base shields. As ship takes damage it affects performance.
Enemy drones priority is to mine ore to build the super base. Once one mines a piece of ore, it will return it to the nearest base. When that base gets enough ore, it will upgrade to a super base.
The player home base is in the center of the field.
If Drone gets destroyed and it had cargo, that cargo gets ejected into space.

Impliment:
